<title> Welcome to Legacy Creative Communications"</title>
<h1> I am the Arcstrider.</h1>
<h2> Welcome to Legacy Creative Communications. For too long humans have been held captive by screens, likes, and follows. It is time we move on. To "About Face", and "Forward March" away from the society we have stumbled into.</p>

<p> Below are a collections of tools I have created, or are in the process of developing, to help people connect, IRL. From Tabletop RPG tools, to clever ways to convey nuanced emotions, to a Trading Card Game, we are focused on bringing group chats offline.</p>

<h1>No Likes. No Friends. No Algorithms</h1>
<h3>Just you, an odd website, and too much time on your hands.</h3>
<h4>Just like 1999.</h4>
<br>
<br>
<h2> Below is an assortment of tools for your entertainment. These are all in development for my upcoming card game Fiction Fightsâ„¢.</h2>

<h3 style: color="white">Fiction Fights is a Narrative Driven TCG I am developing.
Currently, The Arcstrider is making his rounds recruiting. <p>
  You can watch him recruit players for Arcstrider's Arena, 
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100025663193707" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>
</h3>
<br>
Summon Fiction from the public domain into your party and prepare for Narrative Battle.
<br>
Equip them with legendary items, like Excalibur, or Popeye's Spinach.
<br>
Challenge Antagonists, your opponent's protagonist cards, to narrative duels depending on the location and scenario.
<br>
Do you have the skill, or the gear, to rise to the challenge?
<br><h3>
<p>Fiction fights is being developed, and marketed by, Legacy Creative Communications. I am a sole developer on a quest to bring people back to the days of sitting around, swapping stories. It's time to take the social back from social media.</p>
<br>
If you would care to help support this endeavor, you can use the link below. I have offered an assortment of gizmos for something to do while you are here. But, It's more than that.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h2> These gizmos showcase the scoring system from Fiction fights.</h3>
<h3> AND Include a challenge checker, or will when it's completed.</h3>

<p> I appreciate your time, and thank you for visiting my little webpage.</p>

<h1>Please accept this growing assortment of oddities and gizmos.</h1>
<p> I have spent months developing the underlying rule system for this card game. Working out how character interactions work on more emotional levels. The results became the Legacy Systemâ„¢.<br> Fiction Fights is a display of the power of the Legacy Systemâ„¢. 
<br>
<br>
As you can probably guess, this has been a lot of work, and very time consuming. I would love to continue working on this project full time.<p>

<h2>Please consider the below as portfolio for creative problem solving, graphic design, web design, and narrative driven web tools.</h2>

<h3>Please consider me for any creative communication needs you may have. </h3>
<p> I have over 8 year's experience in graphic design. 3 years in screen printing, and the remainder in small business branding. <br>

I have a certificate in Visual design, as well as a certificate in Audio Arts, both from Full Sail Online. I would like to claim to have a few years worth of experience in web development, but this has been my first venture into web design. I have been at this project for a couple of weeks. I am using ai to help me learn, and be productive. This is how I am able to produce such creative interfaces, while still learning what I am doing.</p>
